# Day 65 - Web Design School (How to Create a Website People Love)

## Notes:

### Color Theory
- When picking colors in a website, it's important to remember color moods (i.e. Red = love/energy/intensity/excitement, Blue = calm/relaxation/trust, etc., yellow = joy/intellect/attention, green = freshness, safety, growth, purple = royatlty, wealth, feminity)

- Analogous: colors are colors that are very close to each other in hue and saturation. These are great for things like navigation bars

- Complementary: Colors that are opposite on the color wheel and used to make things pop. Do not style text and text barckground with this. Keep this to things like logos, buttons, and icons.

### Typography:

- Serif Font Family: Characters have "feet" at the edges
- Sans-Serif Font Family: Characters do not have the "feet" at the edges

### User Interface Design (UI):

1. Hierarchy:
    * Most important information is conveyed first using things like colour, font, and size.
2. Alignment:
    * Want to aim for around 34 characters per line in a text box 
    * Minimize the number of alignment points. This way designs will look a lot more coherent.
3. White Space:
    * White space emphasises & elevates elements
4. Audience:
    * Need to be mindful of the audience you are designing for.

### User Experience Design (UX):

- User Experience Design (UX) is the process of designing a product or service that is intuitive, easy to use, and easy to understand.
1. Simplicity:
    * The user should be able to easily understand the product or service.
2. Consistency:
    * Functionality and design of the product should be consistent across different parts of the app.
3. Reading Patterns:
    * People's eyes generally start at the top left of the screen.
    * Can use the F-layout or the Z-layout 
4. Portability:
    * The design of the product should be consistent and scalable on multiple device types.
