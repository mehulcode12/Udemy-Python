WE Project Outline:

1. In the GUI, the user is prompted for either a single image or a directory of images to append the watermark.

2. The GUI prompts the user to upload the watermark image to be appended to the images.

3. The user selects the desired location of the watermark on the image. And (maybe) can use a sliding bar to select transparency.

4. The user selected the desired output location for the modified images.

5. The user can click 'preview' to see a preview of the image with the watermark once all inputs are satisfied.

6. Once the user clicks 'run', the program iterates through each image and adds the watermark using Pillow, or if an error occurs it reports the error to the logger.
(Error conditions: if the image is smaller than the watermark on the x or the y, if the image is not a supported filetype.)

7. Once the program is finished, the user can find the successful images in the selected output folder.
