# Markit - Image Watermarking

### Hi there! Thanks for checking out my `Markit` project.
### `Markit` is a Python program that makes watermarking images easy.
### This project was a completely self-written and guided course assignment in the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy.
### In this simple program, I mainly aim to showcase my understanding of class structure, error handling, GUIs using PySimpleGUI, and the PIL/Pillow library.
### If you'd like to try this program for yourself, download the 'Markit' folder and install the pipreqs from 'requirements.txt'.
